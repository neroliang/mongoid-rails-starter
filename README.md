constituents at the thames the speech is eminently characteristic of the man and of the minister it is a clear statement of facts and there is an entira absence of any bravado or exaggeration while he up holds the policy of his government in all its details his modesty inferentlally leads his heaaers to believe that he doea not intend to claim that it 1b altogether a heaven-boon policy some of the results hi lays before his hearers are full of interest and will carry due weight with thoughtful people in referring to the criticisms of the more hostile se tions of the press on the land tx he claims that although the farmers of the country had first objected strenuously to fche tax they now were among its strongest supporters formerly if a man increased the value of his tand by improvements the valuer came round and increased his tax but the preent law exempted improvements to a certain extent the ministry had not gone quite so far in this respect as they could wish for but they had made a very yood sfort it will of course be within the recollection of our readers that mr ballance yielded so far last session as to promise that if it were possible he would remit the tax on improvements altogether the return f com that source is only about l 60000 the actual gain to the puhlio will not be so much as the ultimate effect of the affirmation of the principle thit it 1 wrong t tax the fruits of economy and industry while an infinitely preferable source of revenue lies at the hand of goernm ot in the shape of land values there must be a further advance of government in this direction he defends the co-operative system very warmly and for the introduction of which he stives all the credit to mr seddon he denied that the work cost more than ordinary schedule rates and he could say this after 18 months experience while it had the effe t of abolishing the sweating and the truck system the number of contracts let through ut the colony totalled 392 whilst the number of men employed had been over 800 and this he claimed had to some extent stopped the exodus from the colony the same system was in vogue in the lands department as to the labor bureau and its usefulness in reducing the congestion of the labor market he said that 6752 men received assistance while 20000 had been helped by information and otherwise by the bureau to get work this naturally led him oa to the exodus the stoppage of which he justified by a series of fig area which speak for themselves in 1891 the arrivals into the colony had been 14431 and the departures from the colony 17629 or an exceb of 3198 but in 1892 the arrivals had been 18122 and the departures 13164 the arrives thus being in excess by 4958 these figures were at once significant and gratifying and the fact that the other colonies and america and england had asked for information about ihe co-operative syietn and the labor bureau showed that the systems had been pretty well advertised outside and would probably extend to the other colonies in reply to the allegation made by some of he press that the ministry had made this colony a dumping ground for the riff raff of australia mr cadman asserts that not one man from australia had been helped by the labor bureau as all who had applied merely sought forinformatlon as to the moat likely place to find work this ia a most singular experience and worthy of special mention as it would imply that the more abject class is retained in victoria while new zealand receives the energetic and provident which is certainly a most remarkable development it is on the native question that mr cadman speaks in more familiar fashion without giving any detailed explanation as to his reasons for objecting to a committee of leading maorieß being selected to deal with the interests of their tribe or hapa ia the alienation of the tribal lands he takes unqualified exception to mr rees proposal he is sufficlenlly pronounced as to the necessity of providing for the natives by ample reserves as a precaution against their complete pauperisation but he holds that there should be no intervention between the natives and the government he thinks that after reserves have been set aside the government should make a fair offer for the balance of the land either by debentures or otherwiseas it is not wise to give th 9 natives large bums of money if this offer was declined he thought that che natives should bear their fair share of taxation the land purchase bill provided for debentures being given to the natives which was better than allowing their land to be idle in regard to the area of native land purchased by the present government mr cadman said that the late government in three years had parchased only 73000 acres whilst last year the present government purchased 214000 acres and this year they had purchased over 140000 acres la the thames and coromandel districts 14000 acres were under purchase and in the king country 95000 acres had been bought at an expenditure of about 3a 6d per acre the other points touohed upon in the speech contain but little of general interest they are in the main a modest expression of confidence in all the details of the ministerial policy a3 is of course to be expected in the circumstances on that ground he may be excused for his astonishing confidence in the cheviot estate purchase of tho merits of which he mst probably knows little or nothing except in a carefully filtered form he also claims a large measure of rafortn for the government in the native department he thinks that wardens and mining inspractorß should be periodically removed but refrains from giving reasons though he intimates that several more changes would be made in th department of justice on his return to wellington while the book fiend peried of affliction is adding ita page to currant history a little story will not be altogerher out of place a few at least will recognise the details it was in a country btore somewhere in the grey valley when an acquaintance dropped in and observed what appeared to him to be a man in possession but the good lady of the house soon explained the situation that fellow ia there she whispered has been here for hours and i oant get rid of him anyhow he wants me to give him an order for a book and i dont want to you see tom the husband is in town or he wauld soon have to go i dont knov what to do as the fellow will not go away the friend who had a grod deal of experience of the world of men quietly remarked ob i think i can manage him he immediately put on a grave countenance palled out his busi eaa book looked very hard at the stock furniture c and then quietly re marked ias if to himself oh i may as well begin here he then very deliberately began to take an inventory of the contents of the premises in the most business like way the book sharp looked on in a bewildered kind of way for a mnute or two until it began to dawn on him that a bankrupt tradesman was not qaita the class of customer he wanted to subscribe to the greaatest book on airth sir and gathered up his belongings and fled incontinently as if he had a most pressing engagement watting for him not far off perhaps it was as well for the felliw that tom was not at home and this is an instance of how the book fiend pushes trade a correspondent in the grey valley has a good deal to say and a rather round about way of saying it as to the rail way charges of the midland company for the carriage of goods and parcels he impresses on us the fsct that private coaches on the grey main road carry goods and parcels for the public at half the price charged by the company he alleges instances to show that private conveyance is a long way cheaper than the railway this is a matter on which we must plead profound ignorance bui it beams to us that the company ought to know their own business by this time however if private vehicles san ply between greymouth and make a living for their owners they onght to be thankful tht the company are so blind to their own interests as to drive a portion of the fraight trade into private hands evidently if our correspondent facts are correct the settlers ought to be as much indebted to thb coach proprietors as they ought in their turn be thankful that tho company charge such rates as to make coaches possible and profitable a s milr state of thing 3is said to exist with the government railways in other parts of new zealand it seems to us that the anomalies our correspondent has culled attention to may well be left to those most interested and the exigencies of the traffic on the road a meeting of some of the members of the midland hallway league was held at gilmer hotel last evening a resolution was carried instructing the secretary to communlcite wibh the chairman of the christohurch league asking what step they proposed to take now that the government had given their decision on the midland railway proposals mr matheson ute mayor who was chairman of the league ex officio resigned and the present mayor imr w r kettle was elected instead to the office of chairman this concluded the business the attendance was rather small though several members put in an appearance at the close somebody about the kumara times beems to be in a very bad way he lets himself loose as if his feelingß were hurt thus the grey river argus ha 3 distinguished itself in writing on the picturesque atla 3 case as the first paper in ne y zealand that ever upheld the wrong the article is a discredit to greymouth and we shall take particular care that its brutality its coarse partisanship its weakness its studied appeal to the revengeful feelings of the mob are not allowed to pasß without exposure very little more of this kind of thing and his friends will be concerned for him in a bad case of this kind a good remedy is to catch a sympathetic book fiend and procure relief by an interchange of sorrows and a mingling of tears

he was physically and mentally one of the best allround men i ever saw and though-there may have been some of his acquaintances who did not appreciate or understand him i never met anyone who did not respect him he was a quiet man not given to hasty speech but with a wonderful fund of vitality and energy behind his reserve and nothing less than this could have pulled the immense amount of physical and intellectuar work that he crowded into his life he gained high academical honours here he won junior and senior university scholarships took his ba degree in 1889 and his ma the next year with a double class but all the time he was reading for his examinations and playing an active part-hi college life he was doing enough athletics to satisfy three ordinary men though lie wai powerfully built and muscular i should riot say he had like his brothers dr pat and george marshall any exceptional qualifications for success as an athlete except his personal temperament he was above all things persistent cool and resolute and no man ever tried harder at everything ho undertook as a-footballer he wasone of the best centre three-quarters thai ever played in ithe colony-a fine kick a deadly tackle afrif i clever but unselfish scorer i dbllbt if any team in new zealand has ever given so fine an exposition of the four three-quarter game as the canterbury college fifteen of 1888 to 1900 when marshall was at his beef at lawn tennis he was twice champion of the colony and here again he had no special personal adaptation to the game but his courage and strength without a back-hand stroke and without vplley-i ing power he beat the invincible minden fenwiek in 1890 and apain by sheer pluck and energy in 1896 he won the championship from h a parker the most brilliant player the colony has yet produced at cricket marshall suffered from lack of opportunity but at wanganui and wherever else he played he was known as one of the finest bats iv the colony he was one of the few colonials who scored a century against warner team last season and he played cricket as he played every other gamewith all his heart and soul and with a persistent refusal to accept failure or defeat but all this meant a constant strain upon him and in spjte of jiis fine physique his constitution was far from sound in 1889 he played into the final round of the tennis championships at dunedin and collapsed on the last day he was seriously ill for many weeks and i remember well how his first thught when he recovered was to apologia to his partner for breatjbg down but it would give a very false imuresaioti of the man to imply that his best energies were devoted to athletics he played hard as he worked hard because it was his nature to do things thoroughly and his habit to persevere miet completing hjs university course kere lie went home to ctthtbvidge and kept terms there vvhen he came back from cambridge lie became rwn njrtter at christs college ghrirftchureh and lik personal force of character and his devotion to duty combined with jus prowess at football and cricket left a deep impression upon all the boylwha cameunder his charge when he reinpved towangujiuiftb teath and officiate as chaplain in his own old school he took up athletics again as enthusiastically as ever and it was largely owing to his exertions that the wanganui collegiate school has attained its present pre eminence on the football field but everywhere be went he left the mark of a strong resolute man inspired by high ideals and devoted to any and every form of duty that came rin his way another severe illness a few weeks ago compelled him to atop work for the time and then came the final tragic mystery i do not claim to ihave been one of marshall intimate friends but i knew him inmany different capacities and i am glad to put on reiord my respect and admiration for a man who in all the years i knew him never did anything unworthy of the best traditions of british athletics
